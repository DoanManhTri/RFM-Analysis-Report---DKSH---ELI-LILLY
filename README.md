# RFM-Analysis-Report-DKSH
## Executive Summary
This project utilizes RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on a dataset of 123,000 sales transactions involving 5,242 SKUs and 22,600 customers over one year to provide comprehensive insights into customer behavior and segmentation. By understanding and segmenting customers based on their purchase behavior, this analysis offers actionable strategies to enhance customer retention, optimize marketing spend, and increase overall profitability. The project highlights key customer segments and proposes targeted marketing strategies that are projected to improve Customer Retention Rate (CRR) by 15%, increase Revenue per User (RPU) by 12%, and boost Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) by 18%.

Key Insights:

High-Value Customer Segments: Identified key segments such as "Champions" and "Promising Customers" that account for a significant share of revenue. By focusing on these high-engagement customers, targeted loyalty and marketing programs are projected to boost Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) by 18% and Revenue per User (RPU) by 12%.
At-Risk Customer Groups: Segments such as "At Risk" and "About to Sleep" require re-engagement to prevent churn. Personalized incentives and retention strategies for these groups are expected to increase the Customer Retention Rate (CRR) by 15%.
Growth Potential in New and Lost Customers: "New Customers" and "Lost Customers" segments present opportunities for long-term growth. Win-back campaigns and nurturing strategies are estimated to drive further gains in CLV and RPU.
Impact:

The targeted strategies outlined in this RFM analysis are expected to significantly improve key business metrics, including a 15% increase in CRR, a 12% boost in RPU, and an 18% growth in CLV, providing a clear roadmap for driving customer engagement and maximizing profitability.
